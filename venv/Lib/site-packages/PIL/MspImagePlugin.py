    # For RLE encoded files, the 32byte header is followed by a scan
    # line map, encoded as one 16bit word of encoded byte length per
    # line.
    #
    # NOTE: the encoded length of the line can be 0. This was not
    # handled in the previous version of this encoder, and there's no
    # mention of how to handle it in the documentation. From the few
    # examples I've seen, I've assumed that it is a fill of the
    # background color, in this case, white.
    #
    #
    # Pseudocode of the decoder:
    # Read a BYTE value as the RunType
    #  If the RunType value is zero
    #   Read next byte as the RunCount
    #   Read the next byte as the RunValue
    #   Write the RunValue byte RunCount times
    #  If the RunType value is non-zero
    #   Use this value as the RunCount
    #   Read and write the next RunCount bytes literally
    #
    #  e.g.:
    #  0x00 03 ff 05 00 01 02 03 04
    #  would yield the bytes:
    #  0xff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04
    #
    # which are then interpreted as a bit packed mode '1' image
