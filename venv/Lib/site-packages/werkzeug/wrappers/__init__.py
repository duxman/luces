werkzeug.wrappers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The wrappers are simple request and response objects which you can
subclass to do whatever you want them to do.  The request object contains
the information transmitted by the client (webbrowser) and the response
object contains all the information sent back to the browser.

An important detail is that the request object is created with the WSGI
environ and will act as high-level proxy whereas the response object is an
actual WSGI application.

Like everything else in Werkzeug these objects will work correctly with
unicode data.  Incoming form data parsed by the response object will be
decoded into an unicode object if possible and if it makes sense.
