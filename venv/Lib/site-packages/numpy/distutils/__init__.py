An enhanced distutils, providing support for Fortran compilers, for BLAS,
LAPACK and other common libraries for numerical computing, and more.

Public submodules are::

    misc_util
    system_info
    cpu_info
    log
    exec_command

For details, please see the *Packaging* and *NumPy Distutils User Guide*
sections of the NumPy Reference Guide.

For configuring the preference for and location of libraries like BLAS and
LAPACK, and for setting include paths and similar build options, please see
``site.cfg.example`` in the root of the NumPy repository or sdist.
