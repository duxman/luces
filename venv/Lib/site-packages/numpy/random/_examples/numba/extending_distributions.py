Building the required library in this example requires a source distribution
of NumPy or clone of the NumPy git repository since distributions.c is not
included in binary distributions.

On *nix, execute in numpy/random/src/distributions

export ${PYTHON_VERSION}=3.8 # Python version
export PYTHON_INCLUDE=#path to Python's include folder, usually \
    ${PYTHON_HOME}/include/python${PYTHON_VERSION}m
export NUMPY_INCLUDE=#path to numpy's include folder, usually \
    ${PYTHON_HOME}/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/site-packages/numpy/core/include
gcc -shared -o libdistributions.so -fPIC distributions.c \
    -I${NUMPY_INCLUDE} -I${PYTHON_INCLUDE}
mv libdistributions.so ../../_examples/numba/

On Windows

rem PYTHON_HOME and PYTHON_VERSION are setup dependent, this is an example
set PYTHON_HOME=c:\Anaconda
set PYTHON_VERSION=38
cl.exe /LD .\distributions.c -DDLL_EXPORT \
    -I%PYTHON_HOME%\lib\site-packages\numpy\core\include \
    -I%PYTHON_HOME%\include %PYTHON_HOME%\libs\python%PYTHON_VERSION%.lib
move distributions.dll ../../_examples/numba/
