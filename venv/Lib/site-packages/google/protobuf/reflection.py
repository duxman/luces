"""Contains a metaclass and helper functions used to create
protocol message classes from Descriptor objects at runtime.

Recall that a metaclass is the "type" of a class.
(A class is to a metaclass what an instance is to a class.)

In this case, we use the GeneratedProtocolMessageType metaclass
to inject all the useful functionality into the classes
output by the protocol compiler at compile-time.

The upshot of all this is that the real implementation
details for ALL pure-Python protocol buffers are *here in
this file*.
